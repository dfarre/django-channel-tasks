Title: REST API with token auth

Story: |-
  Staff users may obtain a token through Django admin site, and use it to schedule
  concurrent tasks through REST API.
  This covers:
   * The task runner
   * Admin site usage to create API tokens
   * User creation with management command
   * The tasks REST API

Scenarios:
  A user creates an API token:
    - Given a tasks admin user is created with command
    - And the user creates an API `token`
  Single task execution POST with result storage:
    - Given a user creates an API token
    - When a failed `task` is posted
    - Then the task result is correctly stored in DB
    - And $(0) cancelled $(1) error $(0) success messages are broadcasted
  Many tasks execution POST with result storage:
    - Given a user creates an API token
    - When a failed and some OK `tasks` are posted
    - Then the different task results are correctly stored in DB
    - And $(0) cancelled $(1) error $(4) success messages are broadcasted
