Title: Task admin user reation

Story: |-
  As a site administrator,
  I want to create staff users with task management and scheduling permissions,
  so that they can start operating with a temporary password.

Scenarios:
  A task admin is created by command:
    - When a task admin `user` is created by command
    - Then the user has the correct status
