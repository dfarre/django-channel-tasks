Title: A Few Tasks Run

Story: |-
  Several tasks may be scheduled to run concurrently, and their states are broadcasted.

Scenarios:
  Concurrent error and cancellation:
    - When a `failed`, a `cancelled` and some `OK` tasks are scheduled
    - Then corresponding $(started) messages are broadcasted
    - And completion times do not accumulate
    - And the different task statuses are correctly stored
    - And corresponding $(done) messages are broadcasted
