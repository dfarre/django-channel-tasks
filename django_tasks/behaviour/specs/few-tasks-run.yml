Title: A Few Tasks Run

Story: |-
  Several tasks may be scheduled to run concurrently, and their states are broadcasted.
  This covers:
   * The task runner
   * The websocket broadcasting
   * Admin site usage to create API tokens
   * User creation with management command

Scenarios:
  Concurrent error and cancellation:
    - When a `failed`, a `cancelled` and some `OK` tasks are scheduled
    - Then completion times do not accumulate
    - And corresponding messages are broadcasted
    - And the different task statuses are correctly stored
  Task execution POST with result storage:
    - Given a tasks admin user is created with command
    - And the user creates an API `token`
    - When a `failed` and some `OK` tasks are posted
    - Then corresponding messages are broadcasted
    - And the different task results are correctly stored in DB
