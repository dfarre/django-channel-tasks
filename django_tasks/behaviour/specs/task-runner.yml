Title: Task runner

Story: |-
  Several tasks may be scheduled to run concurrently, and their states are broadcasted.
  Task information may also be stored in database.
  This covers:
   * The task runner
   * The DocTask model
   * The websocket broadcasting

Scenarios:
  Concurrent error and cancellation:
    - When a `failed`, a `cancelled` and some `OK` tasks are scheduled
    - Then completion times do not accumulate
    - And $(1) cancelled $(1) error $(4) success messages are broadcasted
    - And the different task statuses are correctly stored
  Concurrent error and success with storage:
    - When a `failed` and some `OK` doctasks are created
    - Then $(0) cancelled $(1) error $(4) success messages are broadcasted
    - And all task results are correctly stored
